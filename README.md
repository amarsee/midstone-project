## Goal

I sought to build an interactive web application to explore NBA stats. I've always been a big basketball fan and I've seen how data has transformed the game in the past decade or so. I created this shiny app as a way for somebody to explore some team level stats based on certain parameters. The three factors in this application are as follows:  
  * Days of rest  
    * For this purpose, days of rest means total time between games (e.g. 1 day of rest means games on back-to-back days because there is 1 total day between)  
  * Time Zone  
  * Home/Away
